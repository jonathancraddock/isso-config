# isso-config

Notes and config relating to a test install of the self-hosted commenting solution, Isso. If you're looking for my notes on the installation, this is probably what you want: [Installation Steps](isso-debian-aptget.md)

## Documents

* [Original Install Activity Log](original-test-log.md)  
This is the activity log I maintained whilst attempting my first install on a test VM.

* [Ubuntu Package Manager Isso Installation Steps](isso-debian-aptget.md)  
This is based on the activity log, but written as a procedure that I can refer back to.

## Files

* Isso server config file: [isso.cfg](isso.cfg)  

* HTML test file: [comment-test-here.html](comment-test-here.html)  

* Supervisor config: [isso.conf](supervisor-isso.conf)
