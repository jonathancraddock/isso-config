# Introduction

This procedure is based on the activity log saved here: [Original Install Activity Log](original-test-log.md). It's intended as a guide for my future reference, but currently not tested on a production server, only on a test VM.

## Description of server

After the actions logged in the document linked above, I reverted to a snapshot of a brand new, clean Ubuntu 16.04 build. It's a basic LAMP server with SSH, and nothing else installed. For the purposes of my testing it's on my home network, AKA **kyabram.lan** and the machine name is **issotest**, hence any later references to **issotest.kyabram.lan**, etc.

## Install Isso Using Package Manager
